# Hardware-for-Handwritten-Digits-Recognition

Model:       Lenet-5.
Ref:         http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-98.pdf

Application: Handwritten Digits Recognition.

Phase:       Training and Inference.

Dataset:     MNIST (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

This appication is implemented on both of Software and Hardware.

The training phase is implemented in Python to generate parameters.
Then the parameters are fed to the inference phase on hardware system.
